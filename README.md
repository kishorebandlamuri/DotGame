# DotGame

This is built as Web API with three calls
The three calls are
- Get - "~/api/Initialize" - Initialize the Game
- Post - "~/api/ValidateStartPoint" - Checks if the start point is a valid point or not
- Post - "~/api/ValidateEndPoint" - Checks if the end point is a valid point or not and based on it would create a line with all the intermediate points. It also decides whether the game is completed or not
